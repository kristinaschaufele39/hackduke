As a CS major hoping to concentrate in AI/ML, I am extremely passionate about seeing more people who look like me and share my background. Additionally, after joining my all-girls high school’s robotics team, I discovered the value of women working for and with women. In robotics, critiquing each other’s ideas is an encouraged and comfortable exercise, and I am much more confident in my academic pursuits as a result of this environment. The opportunity to uplift and lead with other women in the technology space was invaluable, and I want to continue this work in the university space.


In WiT, we all have the shared experience of being women in a traditionally male-dominated space, but many members have other identifiers that contribute to their feelings of marginalization and exclusion in tech. I think creating spaces for members to share and connect about these experiences would promote understanding and encourage allyship across communities. I feel like acknowledging and celebrating our differences will actually build a stronger network and community as we learn from one another. I will personally work towards this by including and listening to all voices, especially those that are traditionally overlooked.


I would love to see bonding events with the members, especially across grade levels so that younger members can have mentors in the field. I think inviting speakers from various sectors would be a great way to demonstrate the wide range of careers that involve and require experience with technology. Finally, I think group study sessions a few times a week, where members can join or pop in would be an informal way to genuinely bond. We could have members on BC or in Perkins at specific times so that people always have someone to work with!
